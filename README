Initial commit of SkIm, a python package for building LOFAR (Other?) Sky Image 
formatted file under HDF5.

THIS IS A PROTOTYPE package only. It does not configure HDF5 image files
with the fully spec'd metadata in LOFAR Sky Image ICD, 
Document ID:LOFAR-USG-ICD-004

skimAll is an updated replacement for skim.py (though both work)

Dependencies:: pytables, pyfits, HDF5

Further dev for casa images and other Measurement Sets:: pyrap, casacore

@TODO  The CLI is a clunk, specifically built for dealing with LOFAR imaging data
as produced by the LOFAR standard imaging pipeline (sip). Command line positional
arugment should be simplified.
